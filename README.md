# reddit-fitness-bot
reddit bot to show information based on the exercise that triggers it [DeltaHacks 6]

This bot will reply to specific comments in the subreddits that it is active in. Upon calling "!exerciseFinder" with a muscle group
afterwards, the bot will reply with a link to the bodybuilding.com page about that muscle group. This way reddit users can easily find
appropraite activities for whichever muscle group they desire. The bot runs under account name "exerciseFinderBOT". It currently does not 
run automatically, and must be ran manually via the script. Automation will require a linux server.
